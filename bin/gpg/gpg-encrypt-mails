# https://makandracards.com/makandra-orga/481783-how-to-encrypt-and-decrypt-gpg-mails-in-the-terminal

# Encrypting
# gpg --encrypt --armor --recipient <receiver@email.address> [--recipient <receiver2@email.address>]
# <type message>
# <ctrl d>

# Now copy the PGP message to your mail client and send that mail.
# You need one -r flag per receiver address
# With a single receiver, you can also write gpg -ear reci@pie.nt

# Decrypting
# gpg -d
# <paste encrypted message>
# <ctrl d>

# Adding public keys
# gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --search-keys <user@domain.com>
# <number of the search result that should be imported>
